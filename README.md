Spaceify
========

**Version 0.3.0 Alpha Centauri (developer-pre-alpha)**

Spaceify is a client-edge-server ecosystem that seamlessly integrates your physical space with the web. With Spaceify you can give web apps controlled access to resources such as big screens, sensors and lighting in your space.

The Team
--------

The Spaceify ecosystem was born as a collaborative effort of researchers from Helsinki Institute for Information Technology (HIIT), Aalto University, University of Helsinki and University of Florida. In late 2014 Spaceify was released as an open source project on github under the MIT license. The original Spaceify team continues active development of the ecosystem, but we also invite new developers to join us. A good way to get started is to publish Spaceify packages on the Spaceify package repository! 

More information about Spaceify, repository and packages can be found from [Spaceify's web page](http://spaceify.org).
