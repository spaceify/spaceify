%register%
  register
  
    Spaceify core requires edge computers to be registred for some of its
    functionalities to work. The registration process is done automatically when
    Spaceify is installed. However, sometimes the registration fails and this command
    is provided to finish the registration. It is highly recommended to finish the
    registration if it failed during installation.
