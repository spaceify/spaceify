The libecap library is required to build and use this adapter. You can get
the library from http://www.e-cap.org/. The adapters can be built and
installed from source, usually by running:

    % ./configure
    % make
    % make install

For documentation, the libecap library implementation, and support
information, please visit the Spaceify website: http://spaceify.net
